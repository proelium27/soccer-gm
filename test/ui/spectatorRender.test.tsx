/**
 * Render harness for the club-free surfaces.
 *
 * These pages exist precisely because a spectator save has no `userTeam`, so
 * the failure they have to be proof against is a lookup that assumes one — and
 * that fails as a throw, which no pure-function test would see. A throw here
 * surfaces as a test failure: server rendering does NOT run error boundaries
 * (React re-throws to the caller), so this sees raw throws regardless of the
 * boundaries App and Layout install around the router.
 *
 * Deliberately cheap. It renders an unplayed world rather than a simmed one:
 * every branch these pages have is about the *absence* of a club, and a season
 * of football would cost ~20s to reach the same code.
